## GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data


## Problems with REST

### Server driven selection

With REST, you might have something like:

```http
GET api.example.com/users/123?include=friend.friend.name&friend.friend.ocupation=engineer
```

GraphQL allows you to represent this query in a cleaner way:

```GraphQL
{
 user(id: 123) {
   friends {
     friends(job: "engineer") {
       name
     }
   }
 }
}
```

### Fetching multiple resources

One of the main benefits of GraphQL is to make APIs less chatty. Many of us have seen an API where we first have to `GET /user` first and then fetch each friend individually via `GET /user/:id/friend/:id` endpoint, this can result in N+1 queries and is a will known performance issue in API and database queries. In other words, RESTful API calls are chained on the client before the final representation can be formed for display. GraphQL can reduce this by enabling the server to aggregate the data for the client in a single query.
