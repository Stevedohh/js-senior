# REST
**REST** (Representational State Transfer) refers to a group of software architecture design constraints that bring about efficient, reliable and scalable distributed systems.

also it's software architectural style that describes a uniform interface between physically separate components, often across the Internet in a Client-Server architecture.


## Architectural concepts

The REST architectural style is designed for network-based applications, specifically client-server applications. But more than that, it is designed for Internet-scale usage, so the coupling between the **user agent** (client) and the **origin server** must be as lightweight (loose) as possible to facilitate large-scale adoption. This is achieved by creating a layer of abstraction on the server by defining **resources** that encapsulate **entities** (e.g. files) on the server and so hiding the underlying implementation details (file server, database, etc.). 

But the definition is even more general than that: any information that can be named can be a resource: an image, a database query, a temporal service, or even a collection of other resources. This approach allows the greatest interoperability between clients and servers in a long-lived Internet-scale environment which crosses organisational (trust) boundaries.
