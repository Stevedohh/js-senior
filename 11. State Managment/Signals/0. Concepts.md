### Signals are reactive primitives for managing application state.

Signals are a way of expressing state that ensure apps stay fast regardless of how complex they get. Signals are based on reactive principles and provide excellent developer ergonomics, with a unique implementation

What makes Signals unique is that state changes automatically update components and UI in the most efficient way possible. Automatic state binding and dependency tracking allows Signals to provide excellent ergonomics and productivity while eliminating the most common state management footguns.

## Which problems are solved by signals?

### The global state struggle

This scenario poses a challenge for traditional Virtual DOM based frameworks, which must update the entire tree affected by a state invalidation. In essence, rendering performance is a function of the number of components in that tree. We can work around this by memoizing parts of the component tree using `memo` or `useMemo` so that the framework receives the same objects. When nothing has changed, this lets the framework skip rendering some parts of the tree.

Whilst this sounds reasonable in theory, the reality is often a lot messier. In practice, as codebases grow it becomes difficult to determine where these optimizations should be placed. Frequently, even well-intentioned memoization is rendered ineffective by unstable dependency values. Since hooks have no explicit dependency tree that can be analyzed, tooling can't help developers diagnose **_why_** dependencies are unstable.

### Context chaos

Moving values into context seems like a worthwhile tradeoff at first, but the downsides of increasing component tree size just to share values eventually become a problem. Business logic inevitably ends up depending on multiple context values, which can force it to be implemented at a specific location in the tree. Adding a component that subscribes to context in the middle of the tree is costly, as it reduces the number of components that can be skipped when updating context. What’s more, any components beneath the subscriber must now be rendered again. The only solution to this problem is heavy use of memoization, which brings us back to the problems inherent to memoization.

## Signals

The main idea behind signals is that instead of passing a value directly through the component tree, we pass a signal object containing the value (similar to a `ref`). When a signal's value changes, the signal itself stays the same. As a result, signals can be updated without re-rendering the components they've been passed through, since components see the signal and not its value. This lets us skip all of the expensive work of rendering components and jump immediately to the specific components in the tree that actually access the signal's value.

The signals version vastly outperforms the update mechanism of any traditional Virtual DOM based framework. In some apps we've tested, signals are so much faster that it becomes difficult to find them in the flamegraph at all.

To achieve this level of performance, signals were built on these key principles:

-   **Lazy by default:** Only signals that are currently used somewhere are observed and updated - disconnected signals don't affect performance.
-   **Optimal updates:** If a signal's value hasn't changed, components and effects that use that signal's value won't be updated, even if the signal's dependencies have changed.
-   **Optimal dependency tracking:** The framework tracks which signals everything depends on for you - no dependency arrays like with hooks.
-   **Direct access:** Accessing a signal's value in a component automatically subscribes to updates, without the need for selectors or hooks.

These principles make signals well-suited to a broad range of use cases, even scenarios that have nothing to do with rendering user interfaces.
