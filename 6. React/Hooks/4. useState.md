`useState` is a React Hook that lets you add a **state variable** to your component. State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.

**Basic syntax**
```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
```

`useState` returns an array with exactly two items:

1.  TheÂ **current state**Â of this state variable, initially set to theÂ **initial state**Â you provided.
2.  TheÂ `set`Â functionÂ that lets you change it to any other value in response to interaction.

To update whatâ€™s on the screen, call the `set` function with some next state:

```js
function handleClick() {  setName('Robin');}
```

## Updating state based on the previous state

Suppose the `age` is `42`. This handler calls `setAge(age + 1)` three times:

```js
function handleClick() {
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
}
```

To solve this problem, **you may pass an _updater function_** to `setAge` instead of the next state:

```js
function handleClick() {
  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(42 => 43)
  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(43 => 44)
  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(44 => 45)
}
```

Here, `a => a + 1` is your updater function. It takes the `pending state` and calculates the `next state` from it.

## Updating objects and arrays in state

You can put objects and arrays into state. In React, state is considered read-only, so **you should _replace_ it rather than _mutate_ your existing objects**. For example, if you have a `form` object in state, donâ€™t update it like this:

```js
// ðŸš© Don't mutate an object in state like this:  

form.firstName = 'Taylor';
```

React cannot update `form`  state in this way because React doesn't know what was changed. We changed the property of `form` object but the ***reference*** remains the same.

Instead, replace the whole object by creating a new one:

```js
// âœ… Replace state with a new object
setForm({
  ...form,
  firstName: 'Taylor'
});
```

Here we changed the ***reference*** of `state` object by creation of new one. And now React knows was changed and can re-render the component.

## Avoiding recreating the initial state

React saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.

```js
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos());
  // ...
```

Although the result of `createInitialTodos()` is only used for the initial render, youâ€™re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if itâ€™s creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.

To solve this, you may **pass it as an _initializer_ function** to `useState` instead:

```js
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos);
  // ...
```


```ad-important
Notice that youâ€™re passing `createInitialTodos`, which is the _function itself_, and not `createInitialTodos()`, which is the result of calling it. If you pass a function to `useState`, React will only call it during initialization.
```
