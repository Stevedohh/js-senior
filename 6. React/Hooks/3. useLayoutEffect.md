`useLayoutEffect` is a React Hook that allows you to perform **side effects** in your components before the browser get to paint the new changes.

**Basic syntax**
```jsx
useLayoutEffect(callback, dependencies?)
```

`useLayoutEffect` fires synchronously after the DOM mutation and before the browser get to paint the new changes. This hook is especially useful for performing DOM measurement like scroll height, scroll width, scroll position and other style on any DOM element.

[Good explanation of this hook here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_OtFAsh6aU)

## useEffect vs useLayoutEffect

```js
useEffect(()=>{
  console.log("I will run second instead of first")
});

useLayoutEffect(()=>{
  console.log("I will run first")
})

```

Here if you check the console, "I will run first", that is, the `useLayoutEffect` actually runs before the `useEffect` runs. This is because `useLayoutEffect` is fired synchronously after DOM is mutated and before the browser paints the new changes.
